# Sentinel.AI

**Sentinel.AI** is a full-stack AI-powered system designed to ethically combat scam call centers using advanced automation, voice synthesis, machine learning, and cloud deployment. It simulates engaging personas, deploys fake trap environments, and gathers behavioral intel to waste scammer time and generate reports for authorities.
